# ⚡️ WattBot – Electricity Meter Reading Assistant

WattBot is a full-stack web application that lets you upload images of electricity meters and automatically extract
readings using a custom-trained YOLO model.  
The project includes a Python FastAPI backend and a React frontend with support for dark mode, currency selection, and
price tracking.

## ⚠️ Model Accuracy Note

The YOLO model was trained on a limited dataset of real electricity meters. If your meter's layout or font style is significantly different, the reading might be misinterpreted.  
If you encounter inaccuracies and want to improve precision for your meter type, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/NirKli/WattBot/issues) contributions are welcome!
